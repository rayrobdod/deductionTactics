Deduction Tactics setup:
1. Choose players and board
*: Network players have to set up here; I see no other way
2. for each player, choose a set from all tokenclasses up to amount allowed by board
Replace 2 with:
	1. For each AI, choose a set of tokenClasses - up to double allowed by board
	2. Tell each ai which set of tokenClasses were chosen in previous step
	3. for each ai, choose tokenClases from set created two steps ago up to number allowed by board
3. Tell each player the initial state of the board
4. First player takes first turn


Would the players setting up asynchronously help?


Networked Setup
1. All players start ‘wizard’
	*. leader chooses “start new game”, is shown an IP:PORT
	*. others choose “join game”, enter IP:PORT of leader
2. Leader chooses board
*. Around here, from user perspective, the same flow as ‘normal’ starts
3. for each player, choose a set from all tokenclasses up to amount allowed by board
4. Tell each player the initial state of the board
5. First player takes first turn
