== a.4.1 ==
=== Minor ===
* Adding Interface: ConsoleInterface_CFN
* Turning the GrassyFieldChess tileset into a precompiled class because
  A: it's low-enough quality to be possible
  B: as a workaround for incredibly slow scripting.

=== Fix ===
* ai NetworkClient will now respond to a "RequestAttackForStatus" with a
		Status attack, rather than a damage attack.
* Main will now properly truncate the list of selected tokens to the availiable
		slots for tokens
* Doesn't consume excessive amounts of CPU at all times from contant repaints…
		… again …

=== Impelemntation detail ===

* Tokenclasses use "DontCare" instead of "Rand" to specify the choose-for-me
		condition.

		is a hit and accessed with a new ai decorator: WithSound

		than a constant lime-green.
  > I would prefer a constant colored ring - like Fire Emblem Tellius - but
  		that would require effort
* Swing view: Now able to display information about more than two players
* Started an interface using the console
* Made the space types actually work as expected.

=== Data Level ===
* Added Forest tileset, because it shows off the Major change in a noticable
		way.
  > MORE CREDITS!!!1!
* Added a Castle-like tileset, because ???
* Removed the supermarket tileset, due to lack of abilty to handle multiple
		types of tiles

  * HumanAI is human controlled and uses a GUI.  
  * HumanAutorecordAI is an extension of HumanAI that uses the same algorithms
    as the computer-controlled players to determine enemy attributes
  * BlindAttackAI is computer controlled and simply tries to attack whatever is
    closest, ignoring whatever it knows about enemy units
  * SleepAbuserAI is computer controlled and will attempt to use sleep to it's
    potential, staying out of enemy range when possible, and putting enemies to
    sleep to reduce range further.
